			</li>
			<li>
				Chop the tomatoes into small dices similar to how you chopped the
				onions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Peel the garlic, then mince them thoroughly using either a chopping
				knife or a mortar and pestle.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a sauce pan, add some olive oil and turn up the heat to
				medium-high.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add chopped onions to the heated pan and saute them for 5-10 minutes
				until golden brown.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the onions have been sauted, add minced beef to the pan and let the
				beef cook for around 10 minutes until it turns brown.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce, and season with salt and pepper.
				Then turn the heat down to low and let the mixture simmer for around 15
				minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<u><strong>Optional:</strong></u> During the final minutes of cooking
				add a small cup of water to the mixture to thicken the sauce.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Second step: Cooking the spaghetti noodles</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Grab a pot and fill around half of it with water, then add a pinch of
				salt to the water filled pot.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place the pot on a stove and turn the heat to high for around 10 minutes
				to let the water mixture boil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the water mixture is finally boiling, turn down the heat to
				medium-low, add the spaghetti noodles and let them cook for 20-30
				minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Carefully observe the noodles as they are being cooked, and turn off the
				heat once they become soft.
			</li>
			<li>
				After the noodles are done, turn off the heat and proceed to drain the
				water from the pot.
			</li>
			<li>Bring the pot back to the stove.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			Final step: Mixing everything together and adding some final touches
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Pour the sauce from the sauce pan into the noodles pot.</li>
			<li>Reheat the pot under medium-low heat and leave to simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile add more seasoning to the pot when needed.</li>
            <li>Once that's done, turn off the heat and proceed to serve a plate of spaghetti üçù</li>
            <li>Optionally add toppings such as chopped parsley to the plate.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Bon app√©tit!</em></strong></li>
