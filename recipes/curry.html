					time favorite recipes to cook. It is incredibly flavorful and
					delicious and can make for a very nutritious lunch. The recipe that I
					personally use is somewhat non traditional but I can still guarantee
					that you will enjoy it.

					<h3>Instructions</h3>
					<p>
						First, we need to prepare the curry sauce. After that, we can
						proceed to cook the rice and then serve the final dish with the rice
						and sauce mixed together.
					</p>
					<h4>First step: Making the curry sauce</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Heat a pan over medium heat and add some olive oil.</li>
						<li>
							Add the chopped onion, ginger, and garlic to the pan and saut√©
							until they become fragrant.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add the curry powder and stir well to coat the onions, ginger, and
							garlic.
						</li>
						<li>Add the chopped tomato and cook until it becomes soft.</li>
						<li>Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a simmer.</li>
						<li>
							Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to
							meld together.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pour the mixture into a blender and blend the mixture thoroughly
							until it becomes more fluid.
						</li>
						<li>Pour the mixture into a pot and heat it over medium heat</li>
						<li>
							Chop the chicken fillet into small dices and add it to the pot
							once the mixture gets hot enough.
						</li>
						<li>
							Leave the mixture to simmer for 15 minutes with the lid closed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Stir in the cooking cream and season with salt and ground black
							pepper.
						</li>
						<li>Simmer for another 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Second step: Making the rice</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Rinse the rice under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
						<li>In a pot, add two cups of rinsed rice and 4 cups of water.</li>
						<li>Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li>
						<li>
							Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid.
						</li>
						<li>
							Simmer the rice for about 15-20 minutes or until all the water is
							absorbed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes.
						</li>
						<li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>
						Final step: Serving the final dish and adding some final touches
					</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Place a serving of rice on a plate.</li>
						<li>
							Add a generous portion of the chicken curry on top of the rice.
						</li>
						<li>Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley.</li>
						<li>Squeeze some lemon juice over the dish for added freshness.</li>
						<li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
						<li>
							<strong><em>Bon app√©tit!</em></strong>
