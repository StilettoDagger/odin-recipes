# Odin Recipes

## Overview

This repository is made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is the first project of the program and its purpose is to test HTML knowledge by building a basic website.

The website merely consists of a single HTML index page which includes links to various recipes. Later on, the project will be expanded so that it also includes CSS to make the website look prettier and more appealing to visitors.
